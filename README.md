## ast2vec

Machine Learning models on top of Abstract Syntax Trees.

Currently, there are implemented:

* id2vec, source code identifier embeddings
* docfreq, source code identifier document frequencies (part of TF-IDF)
* nBOW, weighted bag of vectors, as in [src-d/wmd-relax](https://github.com/src-d/wmd-relax)
